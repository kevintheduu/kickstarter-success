A model that can classify a kickstarter project as likely to succeed or not. 

### Business Application 

As of April 2019, $4.2bn has been crowdfunded for projects through Kickstarter. The platform has a 36.84% success rate for projects with “games” as the most popular project category. 

We are offering a beta model that can produce a likelihood estimation for whether a project will be successful on kickstarter. 

### Methodology 

* Data Exploration 
* Data Cleaning & Encoding
* Create a pipeline
* Create Model 1 using Logistic Regression 
* Create Model 2 using Random Forest Classifier 
* Compare performance of models relative to our client needs

### Model Prediction

* Case 1: A project started in the US with a length of 31 days in the game category with the goal of $20,000 has a probability of succeeding 52% which is better than the overall 35% 

* Case 2: A project started in the US with a length of 29 days in the technology category  with the goal of $7,000 has a 26% probability of succeeding compared to the overall 35%

* Case 3: A project started in Australia with a length of 29 days in the technology category goal of $26,100 has a 10% probability of succeeding compared to the overall 35%
